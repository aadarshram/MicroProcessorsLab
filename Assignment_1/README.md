## Assignment 1: Adder Circuits Simulation and Implementation

This repository contains the Verilog code and testbenches for simulating and implementing various adder circuits as part of Assignment 1. The components include:

- **Half-Adder**
- **Full-Adder**
- **Four-Bit Ripple-Carry Adder**

### Tools Used
- **Xilinx Vivado**: For simulation and synthesis
- **FPGA Board**: For hardware implementation

### Repository Structure
- **Modules**: Verilog files for the half-adder, full-adder, and ripple-carry adder
- **Testbenches**: Verilog testbenches used for simulating the functionality of each module
