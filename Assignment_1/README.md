# Assignment 1: Adder Circuits Simulation and Implementation

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of various adder circuits, showcasing expertise in digital design and hardware simulation. The circuits implemented include:

- **Half-Adder**: Adds two binary digits and outputs the **sum** and **carry**.
- **Full-Adder**: Handles three input bits with outputs for **sum** and **carry**.
- **Four-Bit Ripple-Carry Adder**: Performs addition of two 4-bit numbers with carry propagation.

---

## Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Clean and modular Verilog code for each adder circuit.
- **Simulation & Debugging**:
  - Verified functionality using **Xilinx Vivado**.
  - Waveforms visualized with **GTKWave** for debugging.
- **Hardware Deployment**: Synthesized designs are tested on an **FPGA board** for real-world validation.
