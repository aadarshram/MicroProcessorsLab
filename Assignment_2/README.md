## Assignment 2: Johnson Counter Simulation and Implementation

This repository contains the Verilog code and testbenches for simulating and implementing various parts and the complete of a 3-bit Johnson counter as part of Assignment 2. The components include:

- **D flip-flop (with and without reset)**
- **Clock divider**
- **Decoder**
- **3-bit Johnson Counter**


### Tools Used
- **Xilinx Vivado**: For simulation and synthesis
- **FPGA Board**: For hardware implementation

### Repository Structure
- **Modules**: Verilog files for the d flip-flops, decoder, clock divider and counter
- **Testbenches**: Verilog testbenches used for simulating the functionality of the modules
