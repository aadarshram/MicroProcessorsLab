## Assignment 3: Wallace Multiplier and LCD display

This repository contains the Verilog code and testbenches for simulation and implementation of a Wallace Multiplier, program to display a set of characters on an LCD display and extending the multiplier to display the product on the LCD. The components include:

- **Wallace Multiplier**
- **LCD (for character display)**
- **LCD bonus (for displaying product on the LCD)**

### Tools Used

- **Xilinx Vivado**: For simulation and synthesis
- **FPGA Board**: For hardware implementation
- **LCD**: For hardware implementation

### Repository Structure

- **Modules**: Verilog files for the wallace multiplier, lcd and lcd bonus
- **Testbenches**: Verilog testbenches used for simulating the functionality of the modules
