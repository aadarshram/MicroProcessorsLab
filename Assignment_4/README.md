# Assignment 4: Programming an AVR ATmega8 Microcontroller using Assembly

This repository contains assembly code developed for the **AVR ATmega8 microcontroller** to perform the following tasks:

1. **Find the Maximum and Minimum** of a given set of numbers.
2. **Add a Given Set of Numbers.**
3. **Sort a Given Set of Numbers** in ascending order.

## Tools Used

- **Microchip Studio**: Used for writing, building, and debugging the assembly programs for the AVR ATmega8 microcontroller.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the assembly code for each program:
  - `max_min.asm` - Find maximum and minimum of a set of numbers.
  - `add.asm` - Add a set of numbers.
  - `sort.asm` - Sort a set of numbers in ascending order.
- **`report`**: Includes the detailed assignment report in PDF format.
