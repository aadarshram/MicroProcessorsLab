# Assignment: ARM Assembly Language Programming

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for an assignment based on **ARM Assembly Language Programming**. The assignment involved writing and debugging ARM Assembly programs using **Keil µVision** as the development environment. The focus was on understanding register values, handling errors, and implementing key algorithms in ARM Assembly.

## Tasks Implemented

1. **Understanding Program Behavior and Register Values**:

   - Analyzed a given set of programs, observed the values in registers, and noted error messages displayed during execution.

2. **Finding the 10th Term in a Fibonacci Sequence**:

   - Implemented an ARM Assembly program to compute the 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence.

3. **Dividing a 32-bit Number by a 16-bit Number**:
   - Implemented an ARM Assembly program to divide a 32-bit number by a 16-bit number, handling the division process efficiently.

## Tools Used

- **Keil µVision**: For writing, compiling, and running ARM Assembly programs.
- **ARM Assembly Language**: Used for programming the ARM microcontroller.

## Programming and Debugging

The assignment provided practical experience in:

- Understanding ARM Assembly programming concepts.
- Debugging assembly code by examining register values and error messages.
- Implementing key algorithms like Fibonacci sequence and division in ARM Assembly.

## Repository Structure
