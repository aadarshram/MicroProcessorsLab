# Assignment: ARM Assembly Language Programming for LED Interfacing

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for an assignment focused on **interfacing light-emitting diodes (LEDs)** to an **ARM-based microcontroller** (LPC2378) from **NXP Semiconductors**. The assignment involves writing assembly programs for controlling LEDs on the **MCB2300 Keil-ARM board** equipped with the LPC2378 microcontroller.

## Tasks Implemented

1. **Displaying a Number Using LEDs**:

   - Developed an ARM Assembly program to send signals from the LPC2378 microcontroller to the LEDs on the board to display a number.

2. **Blinking an LED**:
   - Implemented an ARM Assembly program to blink an LED on the MCB2300 Keil-ARM board by controlling the timing and switching of the LED state.

## Tools Used

- **Keil ÂµVision**: For writing, compiling, and running ARM Assembly programs on the MCB2300 Keil-ARM board.
- **LPC2378 Microcontroller**: ARM-based microcontroller from NXP used for interfacing with the LEDs.
- **MCB2300 Keil-ARM Board**: Development board with the LPC2378 microcontroller to run the assembly programs.

## Programming and Debugging

The assignment provided hands-on experience in:

- Interfacing and controlling LEDs with ARM microcontrollers using assembly programming.
- Writing low-level assembly code for controlling hardware peripherals on the MCB2300 board.
- Debugging the program by observing LED behavior and adjusting the code for proper functioning.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code files for the tasks:

  - `led.asm`
  - `led_blink.asm`

- **`report`**: Includes the detailed assignment report with solution explanations, observations, and programming insights.
