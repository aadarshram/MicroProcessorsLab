# Assignment: Digital to Analog Conversion Using LPC2148 Microcontroller

This repository contains the C code for implementing Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC) using the **LPC2148 microcontroller**. The program facilitates generating various output waveforms such as **sinusoidal**, **DC**, **triangular**, and **staircase** waveforms, which are then visualized on an oscilloscope.

## Tools Used

- **Microchip Studio**: For writing and building the C programs.
- **LPC2148 Microcontroller**: A 32-bit microcontroller used to generate the DAC signals.
- **Oscilloscope**: Used to visualize the output analog signals generated by the microcontroller.

## Repository Structure

- **src/**: Contains the C codes for generating DAC signals using the LPC2148.
- **`report`**: Includes the detailed assignment report with solution explanations, observations, and programming insights.

## Report
