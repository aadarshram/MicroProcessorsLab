# EE2016 - Microprocessors Lab

This repository contains the Verilog codes, C programs, assembly language implementations, and reports for various tasks and assignments completed in the **EE2016 - Microprocessors Lab** course during **Aug - Dec 2024** in **Indian Institute of Technology Madras**. The assignments cover a wide range of topics, from basic combinational logic to complex microcontroller interfacing and digital-to-analog conversion, designed to deepen the understanding of microprocessor systems, programming, and hardware design.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into **9 folders**, each corresponding to a specific assignment. Each folder the relevant source code, testbenches, executables, report documentation, etc.

More details about each assignment is provided as a seperate README in the corresponding folder and in their respective reports.

This work is a combined effort of Aadarsh Ramachandiran (EE23B001), Aditya Kartik (EE23B003) and Rohita Datta (EE23B065).
